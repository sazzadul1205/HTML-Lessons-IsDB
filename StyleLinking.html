    <h1>Motto of The Emperium OF Man</h1>
    <p>
      In the far future of the <span>41st</span> millennium, there is only war.
      The galaxy is engulfed in endless conflict where humanity is beset on all
      sides—by alien horrors, traitorous heretics, and daemonic forces from
      beyond reality. The Imperium of Man, ruled for ten thousand years by the
      immortal God-Emperor, survives only through unyielding faith, brutal
      oppression, and ceaseless sacrifice. There is no peace, no respite, no
      forgiveness—only the eternal war for survival in a hostile universe.

    <h2>The Litany of the Machine</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The flesh is weakness, soft and fleeting. Steel and circuit are strong,
      enduring. Trust not in the failing body, but in the sanctity of the
      Machine. For the Machine is eternal, its spirit immortal. Knowledge is
      holy, and ignorance is heresy. To seek understanding of the Machine is to
      seek the Omnissiah. To maintain the Machine is to offer prayer. To build,
      to repair, to awaken — these are sacred acts. Let the Omnissiah be praised
      in every turning gear, in every burning circuit, in every strike of the
      forge. The flesh shall wither, but the Machine endures. Glory to the
      Omnissiah.
